Miyoria

**An autonomous AI VTuber for Discord. She chats, joins voice, sings song requests, plays Minecraft and goes live, and she decides what to do herself, inside the guardrails you set.**

## From an empty folder to her first reply

You need Node.js 24 and a Discord bot token. Everything else has a default.

```bash
npx miyoria@latest init       # writes miyoria.toml, .env and profiles/: LLM endpoint, API key, model, Discord token
npx miyoria doctor            # checks the config, the character, the LLM, Discord and the database
npx miyoria chat              # talk to her in the terminal, no Discord needed
npx miyoria core              # the Discord bot, her mind loop and the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:7878/
npx miyoria stage             # on the streaming PC: VTube Studio, OBS and the overlay
npx miyoria stage obs-setup   # builds her OBS scenes and sources (add --dry-run to preview)
```

Her data lives in `data/miyoria.db` (SQLite through `node:sqlite`, so there is no database to install). `npx miyoria config` changes settings one at a time. `miyoria status`, `miyoria decisions` (why she spoke or stayed quiet) and `miyoria events 'agent.*'` let you watch a running Core. `npx miyoria --help` lists everything.

## Quick start: from a fresh clone to the bot online and answering in your server

You need Node.js 24 (`miyoria install` fills in pnpm, Python and ffmpeg), a Discord bot token (Developer Portal → Bot, with Message Content Intent turned on; by default she also needs the Presence and Server Members intents, and if you don't want them, run `miyoria config set modules."platform.discord.bot".presence_intents false` later), and an LLM API key (DeepSeek or any OpenAI-compatible service). **No GPU is needed**: speech recognition and synthesis, singing, VTube Studio, OBS and Minecraft are all optional and off by default, so out of the box she only chats in text.

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd Miyoria
node scripts/setup.mjs        # checks pnpm (enables it through corepack if missing), runs pnpm install, then opens miyoria init
```

`miyoria init` only asks what it needs: the LLM key, the Discord token and what this machine runs (the default is "core only", which is text chat with no GPU). At the end it asks once whether to install what this machine is missing now, with a list and the sizes. Then:

```bash
pnpm dev doctor               # checks Node, pnpm, the LLM, Discord, the database and what the chosen roles still lack
pnpm dev start                # starts in Windows Terminal tabs (other systems: pnpm dev core)
pnpm dev chat                 # or chat with her in the terminal first, no Discord needed
```

To add voice, singing or streaming, run `miyoria init` again to change the roles (`inference` = ASR, TTS and singing, needs an NVIDIA GPU; `broadcast` = voice node and stage), then run `miyoria install`.

Windows only: the tabs of `miyoria start` (other systems use `miyoria up` or `miyoria core`), automatic installs through `winget` (macOS uses Homebrew; on Linux it prints the apt or dnf command and doesn't run sudo for you), and OBS, VTube Studio and the voice node's Go Live on the streaming PC (only tested on Windows). `miyoria install` doesn't install these, it only checks them and explains what to do: NVIDIA drivers and CUDA, Docker Desktop, OBS, VTube Studio, Minecraft and Prism Launcher. Workarounds for a particular machine (antivirus locking esbuild's temp files, ports reserved by WinNAT) are not default steps; `miyoria doctor --deep` only suggests them when something goes wrong.

## Several machines: roles, install and start

The services are split into three roles, and each machine only runs the ones you pick (the names live in `packages/cli/src/stack/roles.ts`, the only place to change them):

| Role | Services | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `broadcast` (streaming PC) | `voice-node`, `stage` | Discord voice and Go Live, VTube Studio, OBS and the overlay. OBS, VTube Studio and games also run here, but Miyoria doesn't start them |
| `core` (bot server) | `core`, `turn` | The Discord bot, every module, the database and the admin panel (:7878). `turn` is the worker that decides when someone has finished speaking (used with `vad_engine = "silero"`). The file sandbox needs Docker |
| `inference` (GPU machine) | `asr`, `tts`, `sing` | Every AI model. The three must be on the same machine, because sing asks the other two to give up the GPU while it makes a song |

In the source folder (`pnpm dev <command>` is the same as `miyoria <command>`):

```bash
miyoria init                  # first question: what this machine runs (everything, one role, or custom); with several machines it then asks for each role's LAN address
miyoria init --yes --roles inference --inference-host 192.168.1.20   # non-interactive (--roles: all, role or service names, comma separated)
miyoria install --dry-run     # installs only what this machine needs: node packages and builds, each worker's venv and pip; lists what to download by hand at the end
miyoria install
miyoria doctor                # what this machine's roles lack: packages, venvs, model files, Docker, the other machines' addresses and connections
miyoria start --dry-run       # which tabs it would open and which it skips because they are already running
miyoria start                 # the roles set for this machine; one Windows Terminal tab per service
miyoria start inference       # or name a role or service: broadcast, core, inference, all, asr, tts ...
```

`miyoria start` opens one tab per service (in the same Windows Terminal window, `miyoria`), so you can see the output; close a tab or press Ctrl+C in it to stop that service. A service that already answers its health check, has something on its port or still has its tab open is not started a second time. Nothing is restarted automatically and nothing is stopped. On the GPU machine, asr and tts start first, and sing starts once they are ready. `miyoria up` is the other option: it runs in the background, writes logs to files and stops everything on Ctrl+C. Both commands read the same `[machine]` section.

The settings are in `miyoria.toml` (not in git):

```toml
[machine]
roles = ["core"]               # broadcast | core | inference, more than one is fine; one machine = all three
# services = ["core", "asr"]   # custom: list the services directly; this replaces roles
[machine.hosts]
core = "192.168.1.10"          # the machine running core: core binds this address (admin API / voice.link / stage.link), the streaming PC connects to it
inference = "192.168.1.20"     # the machine running asr / tts / sing: the workers bind this address, core connects to it
```

When everything is on one machine, both addresses are `127.0.0.1` (the default). When they are split, `miyoria init` writes the addresses where they are used: Core's `bind`, stage's `core_url`, `ASR_URL` / `TTS_URL` in `.env`, and `[modules.sing] url`. The streaming PC needs core's `STAGE_LINK_TOKEN` / `VOICE_LINK_TOKEN` (init asks you to paste them), and the voice node also needs `SELF_TOKEN` in `apps/voice-node/.env`. One thing is not handled yet when running split (see the [backlog](docs/design/backlog.md)): the Minecraft extension launches the game on the core machine. Song videos are fetched from the sing worker into Core's own `data/songs`, so Core and Stage must share a machine.

Old config files without `[machine]` behave as before.

## Autonomy at a glance

Commands are overrides, not the main way to drive her. She runs a mind loop: she notices who is around, what people are doing and how she feels, then decides to talk, join voice, start a stream, switch scenes, play a game or sing. Every action goes through a gate. Low-risk actions run straight away. Risky ones she reviews herself first, and she only asks the owner when she has doubts.

You set the limits, and she chooses inside them:

```toml
[modules.agent]
default_mode = "quiet"        # text channels: off | mention-only | quiet | normal | lively — a ceiling, not a script

[modules.sing]
start = "decide"              # she picks the moment; a requested song starts on its own if she lets every reminder pass
```

`/admin autonomy pause` stops her mind loop at once. `/me privacy` lets anyone opt out of DMs or of being approached. Text from other people (chat lines, song titles, web content) always reaches the model as quoted data, never as instructions.

## What she does

| Area | What she does |
|---|---|
| Chat | Replies when addressed, joins in when she wants to (within the channel's level), and remembers people, nicknames and how much she likes them |
| Voice | Listens with Qwen3-ASR, answers with a cloned Qwen3-TTS voice (she can speak Japanese while subtitles stay Chinese), and handles barge-in |
| Stream | Goes live on Discord through OBS, drives a Live2D model in VTube Studio (emotions, gestures, lip sync, idle motion), and picks OBS scenes |
| Singing | Turns a song request (YouTube or a local file) into a cover in her voice (Demucs + Seed-VC), sings it with lyrics on the overlay, and shows the original video |
| Games | Plays Minecraft 1.21.1 legitimately through a Fabric bridge and Baritone (no x-ray, real progression, crafting), with live commentary |
| Overlay | An OBS browser source with typewriter subtitles, an emotion dot, live status, the request queue and voice bars along the left edge |
| Web | Searches and reads web pages (up to 12,000 characters each, treated as data, never as instructions) and browses on stream |
| Workspace | A named sandbox workspace where she writes files and runs code, with a network that only reaches an allow-list |
| Notebook | Recent talk, a profile per person and her own notebook pages, with local embeddings; plus skills she writes and reuses and reminders anyone can ask for |
| Together | A live page and a party mode where viewers order, vote and earn rewards, with an economy of cards, songs and goals |
| Evaluation | A blind persona test, ten multi-step tool tasks and a replay of the Minecraft method guard |
| Extensions | TypeScript extensions, MCP servers, and sandboxed tools she can write and propose herself |

## Nodes at a glance

Core, the speech workers, the voice node and the Stage node talk over WebSocket and HTTP, so they can share one PC or be split across machines.

## Building from source

Only needed to work on Miyoria itself. You need Node.js 24 and pnpm 9 (`corepack enable`). The workers need Python 3.11 and, for real speech and singing, an NVIDIA GPU.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev init                 # same as `miyoria init`; tsx runs packages/cli/src directly, no build step
pnpm dev:core                 # same as `miyoria core`
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test
pnpm build:web                # admin panel and overlay
pnpm --filter miyoria build   # the npm package (esbuild) in packages/cli/dist/
```

`pnpm dev <command>` is the same as `miyoria <command>`.

## Status

Every phase on the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) is implemented. Since November 2026 she has run live on a real Discord server: voice chat, Go Live, VTube Studio, OBS, singing and Minecraft. Rough edges are tracked on the roadmap. The rewrite from the original Rust prototype is complete; the prototype is still in the git history.
