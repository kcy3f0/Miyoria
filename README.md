Miyoria
=======

**An autonomous AI VTuber for Discord. She chats, joins voice, sings song requests, plays Minecraft and goes live, and she decides what to do herself, inside the guardrails you set.**

## From an empty folder to her first reply

You need Node.js 24 and a Discord bot token. Everything else has a default.

```bash
npx miyoria@latest init       # writes miyoria.toml, .env and profiles/: LLM endpoint, API key, model, Discord token
npx miyoria doctor            # checks the config, the character, the LLM, Discord and the database
npx miyoria chat              # talk to her in the terminal, no Discord needed
npx miyoria core              # the Discord bot, her mind loop and the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:7878/
npx miyoria stage             # on the streaming PC: VTube Studio, OBS and the overlay
```

Her data lives in `data/miyoria.db` (SQLite through `node:sqlite`, so there is no database to install). `npx miyoria config` changes settings one at a time. `miyoria status`, `miyoria decisions` (why she spoke or stayed quiet) and `miyoria events 'agent.*'` let you watch a running Core. `npx miyoria --help` lists everything.

## Autonomy at a glance

Commands are overrides, not the main way to drive her. She runs a mind loop: she notices who is around, what people are doing and how she feels, then decides to talk, join voice, start a stream, switch scenes, play a game or sing. Every action goes through a gate. Low-risk actions run straight away. Risky ones she reviews herself first, and she only asks the owner when she has doubts.

You set the limits, and she chooses inside them:

```toml
[modules.agent]
default_mode = "quiet"        # text channels: off | mention-only | quiet | normal | lively — a ceiling, not a script

[modules.sing]
start = "decide"              # she picks the moment; a requested song starts on its own if she lets every reminder pass
```

`/admin autonomy pause` stops her mind loop at once. `/me privacy` lets anyone opt out of DMs or of being approached. Text from other people (chat lines, song titles, web content) always reaches the model as quoted data, never as instructions.

## What she does

| Area | What she does |
|---|---|
| Chat | Replies when addressed, joins in when she wants to (within the channel's level), and remembers people, nicknames and how much she likes them |
| Voice | Listens with Qwen3-ASR, answers with a cloned Qwen3-TTS voice (she can speak Japanese while subtitles stay Chinese), and handles barge-in |
| Stream | Goes live on Discord through OBS, drives a Live2D model in VTube Studio (emotions, gestures, lip sync, idle motion), and picks OBS scenes |
| Singing | Turns a song request (YouTube or a local file) into a cover in her voice (Demucs + Seed-VC), sings it with lyrics on the overlay, and shows the original video |
| Games | Plays Minecraft 1.21.1 legitimately through a Fabric bridge and Baritone (no x-ray, real progression, crafting), with live commentary |
| Overlay | An OBS browser source with typewriter subtitles, an emotion dot, live status, the request queue and voice bars along the left edge |
| Extensions | TypeScript extensions, MCP servers, and sandboxed tools she can write and propose herself |

## Nodes at a glance

Core, the speech workers, the voice node and the Stage node talk over WebSocket and HTTP, so they can share one PC or be split across machines.

```
packages/         The Core modules (@miyoria/*): kernel, agent, mind, self, world, memory, voice, stage, sing, game, ...
apps/panel        Admin panel (React + shadcn/ui), served by Core on :7878
apps/overlay      OBS browser-source overlay, served by the Stage node on :7884
apps/voice-node   Self-account voice node: Discord voice and Go Live streaming
workers/          Python GPU workers: asr (:8003), tts (:8002), sing (:8005), plus fakes for testing
extensions/       The Minecraft bridge mod and adapter, and example extensions
profiles/         Characters: persona, voice, avatar mapping (the first one is DeepSeek-chan)
deploy/           Dockerfile and Compose files for Core and the speech workers
docs/             Architecture, design notes, protocols, decisions and the roadmap

## Building from source

Only needed to work on Miyoria itself. You need Node.js 24 and pnpm 9 (`corepack enable`). The workers need Python 3.11 and, for real speech and singing, an NVIDIA GPU.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev init                 # same as `miyoria init`; tsx runs packages/cli/src directly, no build step
pnpm dev:core                 # same as `miyoria core`
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test
pnpm build:web                # admin panel and overlay
pnpm --filter miyoria build   # the npm package (esbuild) in packages/cli/dist/
```

`pnpm dev <command>` is the same as `miyoria <command>`.

## Status

Every phase on the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) is implemented. Since November 2026 she has run live on a real Discord server: voice chat, Go Live, VTube Studio, OBS, singing and Minecraft. Rough edges are tracked on the roadmap. The rewrite from the original Rust prototype is complete; the prototype is still in the git history.
