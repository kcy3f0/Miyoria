// Whether what she says she did really happened (v2 §1.8 #5: no string as protocol).
//
// What she did is structured: every body transition a tool of hers asked for is an
// ActivityManager task tagged with her turn (the `TransitionResult` her tool got back: started /
// queued / already / refused), and what came back later is an `agent.notice` with its task id.
// The snapshot says what is true now. A line of hers that says she joined voice, went live or
// started a game is fine when one of those backs it.
//
// Only the claim itself is still spotted in her text (`CLAIMS`): that is the one thing no
// structured signal carries, and without it she could tell someone "我游過去了" or "我重新進一
// 次" when nothing happens (the model does that). It is a safety net, not the protocol: it never
// decides what happened, and a claim backed by a task, a notice or the current state is never
// questioned.
