// Turn coordinator: one per conversation context.

// Debounces incoming messages into turns and keeps at most one turn in flight. Every turn has a

//
// A text reply is committed once it is handed to the scheduler (from then on input only waits);
// a voice reply is never regenerated. Every turn ends with one `agent.turn.outcome`; the ones
// cancelled here (restarted, superseded, shut down, an intent that expired or was replaced) are
// published by the coordinator, the others by the turn.
//
// In voice channels the debounce is shorter (shorter still when someone calls her, and when a
// model judged the speaker done there is little left to wait for), but it is extended (up to
// `voice.max_debounce_ms`) while someone is speaking. It counts from the person's last sound, not
// from the transcript: the voice node's silence and ASR were already part of the same wait. When
// someone calls her and part of it is left, her turn starts at once and holds its output until
// the wait is over; anything new before that drops it and the merged turn starts over (bounded by
// `voice.speculate_max_per_min`, counted in `miyoria_agent_voice_speculation_*`).
//
// An initiative request starts a turn without input, but only when the context is quiet: no
// turn in flight, no debounce pending, no speech of hers still queued; a wish or followup about
// someone also waits while she answers them, and a minute after (`ANSWERED_HOLD_MS`). While the
// Arbiter runs that is all the coordinator decides (the Arbiter retries a busy place); every rule
// (cooldowns, the level's gap, caps) is the Arbiter's. Without it the old checks apply here: her
// last words a few seconds old and the level's gap.
//
// An intent (something her mind loop decided) waits instead: it never interrupts a turn in
// flight, waiting messages or her queued speech (nor, in voice, someone still talking) and
// starts once the context is free, unless it expired meanwhile. A newer intent replaces a
// waiting one.
//
// A question nobody answered (text channels of the main line) is looked at again once it stood
// `[modules.agent.rhythm] question_secs` with nobody saying anything after it: a turn on that
// message, which attention lets through as a look only if the cap allows (v4 §7.2).
//
// Under `pipeline = "v3"` someone calling her while she speaks on her own, or something urgent,
// cuts in as far as the Floor's interrupt level says (§7.3): `wrap_up` finishes the sentence that
// is playing and drops the rest, `cut_short` and `interrupt` stop that sentence too.
