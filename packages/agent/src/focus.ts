// Turn ownership (docs/design/v2-architecture.md §3.9): every turn knows whom it answers.
//
// `selectFocus` splits a turn's input into `focus` (the messages that called her, plus the
// same people's follow-ups) and `background` (everything else). The prompt's "要回的訊息"
// block only shows the focus, naming who asked, and the reply quotes its first message.
//
// `TurnFocusBoard` keeps the focus of every turn in flight (or still speaking) per context:
// the agent provides it as `TurnFocusViewKey` so voice barge-in can ask, on its hot path, whom
// the turn is for, and every change is published as `agent.turn.focus`.
