// / 安靜 / 一般 / 活躍 (plus the old 每則都回). A level is a ceiling, not a setting of her
// personality: she still chooses how talkative she is there (`SelfState` talkativeness, the
// `channel_activeness` tool), but whatever she chooses is capped by the level, and the level
// also bounds her own conversation starts there (`startGapMs`, applied by the Arbiter as one of
// its rules; without it by the agent). All numbers are here.
//
// Voice contexts have no ceiling: the voice numbers (`[modules.agent.voice]`) apply as before.
//
// The rhythm of text channels under the main line (v4 §7.2, §7.3) is here too, as numbers the
// owner sets (`[modules.agent.rhythm]`, `RhythmConfigSchema`) and the per-channel ledger that
// holds them (`Rhythm`): how many looks she takes an hour, how often she may react with an emoji,
// and how her several short messages are spaced.
