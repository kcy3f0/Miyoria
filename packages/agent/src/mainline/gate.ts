// and `accepted` backs nothing. Which sentence is a claim is still read off its words (claims.ts):
// no structured signal carries that, so it only ever decides what to hold, never what happened.
//
// A sentence that claims something too early is held, and so is everything after it, to keep the
// order. Once the stream ended the actions are known, and each held sentence goes one of three
// ways: out as it is, parked for its result (she says "started" meanwhile), or dropped.
