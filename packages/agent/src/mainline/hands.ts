// The hands (docs/design/v3-architecture.md §10.3): the mouth never waits for them. Every action
// of an output runs here, in the background, and leaves two kinds of lines in the log: `action`
// when it goes out and `result` for what came of it, `accepted`, then `done` or `failed`. Accepted
// is a receipt and nothing else (§10.1): a line that says it is done waits for `done`.
//
// A tool that answers with a task in its data, or whose turn started an ActivityManager task, only
// got accepted. The task's end decides. Anything else is done when it answers.
