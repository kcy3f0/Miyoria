// Which tools a chat turn is offered, by what she is doing now (v2 §3.4 Converse): no game tools
// while she is just chatting, the running game's goal capability while a game runs, nothing to
// stop that is not running. The one source is the ActivityManager snapshot; without it, world's
// `her` status (or nothing: every tool stays, the behaviour before the ActivityManager).
//
// A game adapter's raw tools (`game_<id>_observe` / `_act`) are never offered, whatever the
// state: they live behind the gate (`GatedToolsKey`, W3) and only reach a turn through the
// gated `game.*` capabilities. A registry that still holds one (an old extension host) does not
// get it past this filter.
