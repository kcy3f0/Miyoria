// One turn: attention decision, prompt assembly (compiler.ts: her own state in the trusted
// system part, everything derived from other people in the user-role data message), generation
// (with the tool loop; tool calls run for the speaker as principal `user`) and output, filtered
// by `safeOutgoing` (moderation, then `filterOutgoing`). The reasoning level comes from `[llm.reasoning]` per reasoning purpose
// (`chat_text`, `chat_voice`, `chat_intent`; off by default for replies). Text replies go out
// line by line as they are written; voice replies are spoken sentence by sentence while the
// model is still generating (links and code blocks go to the voice channel's text chat instead
// of being read out), a bilingual line as soon as its `<voice>` part is complete.
//
// The turn answers its focus (focus.ts): the "要回的訊息" block shows only the focus messages,
// naming who asked, and a reply quotes the first of them. Every turn ends with one
// `agent.turn.outcome` (sent / silence / error here; the coordinator publishes cancellations).
//
// Before generating, a turn waits (bounded) for a cold session's backfill, fetches reply
// parents missing from the history and picks the images she looks at (history.ts, vision.ts).
//
// An initiative turn has no input and skips attention (the coordinator already checked the
// context is quiet). An intent turn (her mind loop decided to act or talk) has no input either,
// skips attention and offers tools, which run as principal `self` (tools that need a person's
// permission node are refused); her plan goes into the data message. While the LLM budget is exhausted nothing is generated: a turn she would
// have answered gets a canned line at most once per context per `budget_notice_interval_ms`.
//
// Under `pipeline = "v3"` (`Agent.mainline`) a turn is a turn of the main line: it holds the Floor,
// makes one call for what she says and does (`TurnOutput`, no tool loop: the hands report back in a
// turn of their own), every line goes through the gate and the ledger (mainline/), and a call that
// fails ends in a fixed line instead of silence. `#speakMain` is that path; the rest is shared.
