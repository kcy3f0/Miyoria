// One wish, asked once (docs/design/v4-plan.md §2.4, §7.6): the replay of 2026-11-10, when she
// asked one person, S, the same thing ten times in 100 minutes. A proposal from memory opened a
// turn in which she only promised; the promise came due and she asked S by DM; S answered there;
// then every time S spoke in the channel ("you already asked me in DM", "you asked me several
// times already") she asked again, because the promise, the board and her Plan still held it.
//
// The model here does what her prompt says: while the prompt holds the open wish she asks, and
// once nothing holds it she does not. So what is counted is what the system put in front of her.
