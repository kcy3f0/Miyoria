// Read-only. It joins the two logs the turn engine keeps: every turn has an outcome row
// (`agent.turn.outcome`; a turn the gate refused ends in `silence`) and a decision trace whose
// reasons say which gate stopped it. A trace without an outcome row (older data, or a write that
// was lost) is counted too; it carries no `TurnReason`, so its reason is read off what the gate
// wrote (`attention.ts`): "replying to her" marks a follow-up, "direct:" an addressed one,
// `intent:` / `initiative:` her own. Whatever is none of these was ambient.
// The aggregation is a pure function over records; the route only fetches and clamps.
