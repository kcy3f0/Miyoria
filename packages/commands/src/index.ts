// @miyoria/commands: platform-agnostic command framework.
//
// Commands are declared once as a `CommandSpec` with a handler (and optionally component routes
// and autocomplete handlers) and registered in the `CommandRegistry`, which the `commands`
// module provides as the `CommandRegistryKey` service. Platform adapters map specs to their own
// syntax (Discord slash commands, chat `!cmd`, CLI, panel), turn calls into an `Invocation` and
// send back the `CommandReply`: plain text plus an optional card (see `reply.ts`).
//
// Replies follow one visibility rule (`replyEphemeral`): the command's visibility, except that
// warnings and errors are always ephemeral. The visibility is the command's declaration
// (`CommandSpec.ephemeral`, public unless set) or the override of `[modules.commands.visibility]`.
// Controls on replies carry ids `mi:<route>:<params>` and are routed by the registry to the
// command that declared the route, under that command's permission; their `reply` answers
// follow the command's visibility too. A press always runs as the presser.
//
// Discord shows the whole tree plus the panels: `/miyo`, `/song`, and `i` (interactive) under a
// command that has subcommands (`/me i`, `/admin i`).
//
// Permission checks use the `Authorizer` service (the `auth` module's RBAC) when it is
// available. Without it the fallback `Permissions` applies the same built-in role grants
// (`nodes.ts`) to owners, guild admins and everyone else. Commands with `admin.*` / `owner.*`
// nodes are written to the `AuditLog` service when there is one.
