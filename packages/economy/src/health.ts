// The economy's health table (docs/design/v4-plan.md §10): per day, how many coins were issued (what
// people earned for being with her and playing) against how many were recovered (what they spent
// on her and on the shop), and whether, over the last week, less than `health_warn_ratio` of what
// was issued came back, which is what inflation looks like before anyone feels it.
//
// The numbers come from the ledger, the single source of truth; this only adds them up. The ledger
// store does not have a per-day, per-reason total yet, so `LedgerStatsStore` is the port it will
// implement (one `GROUP BY`, SQL in the integration notes of the change that added it); with none,
// the table says it is not available rather than inventing numbers.
