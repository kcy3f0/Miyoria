// @miyoria/game: the game director (module `game`).
//
// A game adapter extension registers the task executor of `game.<id>` (v2 §3.8) and publishes
// `game.<id>.*` events. While a session runs (`game start`) the director observes the game
// through the executor every `decide_secs` (sooner on trigger events), asks the LLM purpose
// `game` (JSON mode) for `{goal, goal_status, action, commentary, mood_nudge}` and starts the
// action as a task with an id and a budget (`game.act`, through the gate); the task's
// `game.<id>.task.done|failed` event (with a failure code) ends it, and every goal that ends is
// published on `game.director.goal` with its code. After a failure it withholds the low-level
// move / mine actions for a while, so she changes method or goal. It consumes
// `queue.item_activated` items of kind `game_goal` as locked goals; requests live commentary
// with `agent.initiative` (reason `game`); nudges the mood on deaths and achievements; and
// contributes a `game` prompt section. The one timeout policy is in `timeouts.ts`.
