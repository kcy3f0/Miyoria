// Head-pats from the page (docs/design/v4-plan.md §9.2 step 2).
//
// A pat is counted against two limits (per person, everyone together) and joins the batch that
// is open; a batch closes `coalesce_secs` after its first pat and becomes one Observation: "Owen
// patted your head 3 times, and two people you do not know did too". It always has the same
// attention key and a revision that only goes up, it is low salience, and it says nothing for
// her: whether she reacts, and in what words, is the main line's (§15). Nothing here speaks,
// writes a line, or asks for a turn.
//
// Someone she blocked is answered exactly like anyone else and their pat goes nowhere, so the
// page cannot be used to find out who is blocked.
