// @miyoria/memory: long-term memory (module `memory`).
//
// * Consolidation: when a context goes quiet (or many lines piled up), new log lines are
//   summarized by the `summarizer` purpose into an episode, facts, her own notes and followups,
//   written from her perspective, deduplicated against existing records and stored.
// * Retrieval: hybrid score of vector similarity, full text, recency, importance and "about
//   someone present", restricted to the scopes visible in the current context (`scope.ts`).
//   Embeddings are optional.
// * Privacy: what is learned in a DM stays in that DM.
// * Prompt contributor `memory`, tools `remember` / `recall`, commands
//   `/me memory show | forget | export`, `/admin memory wipe`, a `FollowupSource` and daily
//   forgetting.
//
// V3 (docs/design/v3-architecture.md §11) adds discipline, not a new system:
// * Three layers: `PinnedMemory` (persona, rules, open commitments, one line per person present:
//   always in the prompt, capped, never retrieved), the EventLog as evidence, and derived memory
//   behind `MemoryRetrieval`.
// * Every memory says whether she lived it or was told it (`origin`); a person fact is stored
//   only when a line somebody said backs it (`evidence.ts`); what is happening right now is
//   refused, the state machine answers that. Confidence fades on read.
// * `forget` follows the evidence: what is about a person, told by them or derived from their
//   events goes; the log itself has its own wipe.
