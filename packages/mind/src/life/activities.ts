// Her life of her own (docs/design/v4-plan.md §8.1, §8.2): the things she can do when nobody
// needs her, each tied to a capability, and who decides which one fits now.
//
// 2026-11-10: the owner's complaint was that she only plays games or sings and "is not
// autonomous". The cause (§2.8) was that her wants led nowhere else: `explore` had no capability
// at all, and nothing pushed her to the web, a diary or code. Every row here names the
// capabilities that do it; a row whose capability is not registered (the party games, the
// notebook and the diary are being built in other packages) is skipped, not imported, so it
// lights up the day its package registers it.
//
// Pure: the mind gathers the situation, this ranks. Owner rules, quiet hours and budgets stay
// above anything here (§8.4): a held capability, a budget that is not ok or a row over its share
// of her day is never suggested, and the share also stops her own Plan (`overShare`).
