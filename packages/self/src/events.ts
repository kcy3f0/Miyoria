// The rule-event table (docs/design/v2-architecture.md §3.6): cheap, immediate meanings of what
// happens to her. One table, no LLM: an event kind goes in, a list of effects comes out
// (which emotion, how strong; toward the person; being with someone). The strengths are the
// shared `APPRAISAL_STRENGTH` steps; the emotion engine turns them into numbers (her
// temperament's gain, habituation, inhibition, the budget).
//
// Appraisal (what an interaction meant, the LLM) is the other input; it does not come here.
