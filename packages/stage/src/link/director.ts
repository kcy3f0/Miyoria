// The scene director: switches OBS to the scene of her current situation.
//
//   going live           → starting (for `starting_ms`), then chat
//   a game starts        → game;  the game stops → chat
//   live, nobody talking for `brb_after_ms`, or she left voice → brb (back when it ends)
//   she sings a song     → sing (its video plays there); the song ends → back to the scene
//                          before it, unless her situation changed meanwhile (then what fits)
//   her `stage.scene`    → that scene for as long as she asked (a timed override, not a fight)
//   the stream is ending → ending (held `ending_ms` before the stream stops, see `close`)
//
// Which scene fits is a pure function (`scene-rule.ts`): f(presence, broadcast, activity, her
// override) plus the few windows only the stage knows. With the ActivityManager the director
// reads her situation from its snapshot (`onSnapshot`), the one copy everyone else reads too;
// without it, from the bus events as before (`onGoLive`, `onGame`, `onVoice`, `onSong`).
//
// A role without a scene is skipped for the next one that fits (going live without a starting
// scene goes to chat, or stays on the game scene while she plays).
//
// It only reacts to changes (it never "corrects" the scene at boot), coalesces changes within
// `debounce_ms`, keeps `min_switch_ms` between switches and stays out of the way for
// `manual_hold_ms` after someone else switched in OBS. Starting, ending, songs and her override
// are urgent: they skip the waits. Every switch is a `stage.scene` request through the gate
// (principal `director`), so pausing her autonomy also pauses the director. Its switches (and
// the curtain's) run one at a time under one mutex, and the scene it expects is only written
// inside it, so its own switch is never mistaken for a manual one.
