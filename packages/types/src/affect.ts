// Affect and People (docs/design/v2-architecture.md §3.1, §3.6): her feelings with one writer.
//
// Three layers at three speeds: drives (hours, pure homeostasis), emotions (minutes, rule
// events + Appraise) and bonds (days, one card per person). Mood is no longer stored: it is
// derived from the three layers (plus the time-of-day energy curve).
//
// The only inputs to emotions are *events* (`AffectEvent` rule events and `AppraisalEvent`s);
// nobody writes absolute numbers, and the program turns events into numbers (habituation,
// mutual inhibition, a stir budget, decay toward the temperament's baseline). `<emo:…>` tags are
// expression only and never feed back. Plan / mind never write emotions.
//
// The existing `Drives`, `DriveName`, `EmotionName`, `PersonEmotionName`, `EmotionReading` and
// `ShownEmotion` (self.ts) and `Mood` (social.ts) are reused as they are.
