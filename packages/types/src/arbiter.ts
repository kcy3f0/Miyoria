// Arbiter (docs/design/v2-architecture.md §3.3): the one place that decides "now or not" for
// everything that wants her to speak or act, and the Ledger that tells her what she did and
// which limits apply (so she plans with the rules in view instead of hitting them blind).
//
// Every source sends an `Impulse` (directly through `ArbiterKey`, or as an
// `ARBITER_IMPULSE_TOPIC` custom event for modules that only publish). The Arbiter applies the
// floors (budget, rate, quiet hours, consent, pause), orders / merges / preempts (addressed >
// ongoing conversation > her own wishes), records the result and publishes an
// `ArbiterDecision` (`ARBITER_DECISION_TOPIC`).
//
// Until the Arbiter lands, sources keep publishing `agent_initiative` as today; the Arbiter
// takes those over source by source (see docs/design/v2-implementation.md).
