// The live page (docs/design/v4-plan.md §9.2): her, in a browser, as it happens.
//
// The `live` module folds the bus into a small public picture of her (where she is, what she is
// doing, her face, the line she is saying) and pushes every change to whoever watches. A member
// may pat her head from the page; pats are counted, limited and gathered into Observations. Both
// sides are here so the API can serve the feed without depending on the module.
//
// Everything in a `LiveEvent` may be seen by anyone, logged in or not: the module decides what
// gets in (see `packages/live/src/privacy.ts`), nothing downstream filters again.
