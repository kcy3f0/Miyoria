// The three memory layers of V3 (docs/design/v3-architecture.md §11) as the main line sees them.
//
// * Pinned: persona, rules, open commitments and one line per person present. Always in the
//   prompt, capped, never found by retrieval. `PinnedMemory.pinned` is the reader.
// * Log: the EventLog is the evidence (`log-event.ts`).
// * Derived memory: person facts, experiences and topics, tidied in the background. Each says
//   whether she lived it or was told it (`MemoryOrigin`), carries the events it came from and
//   fades with time. `MemoryRetrieval.retrieve` is the reader.
//
// Neither reader runs an LLM or follows links: both are one pass over indexed rows.
