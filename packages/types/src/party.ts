// Contracts of the voice party games (`@miyoria/party`, docs/design/v4-plan.md §9.1) that other
// modules implement, so neither side depends on the other's package:
//
// * `PartyRewards`: coins for the people who played. The economy provides it when it wants to; a
//   game without it simply ends without rewards.
// * `SongClips`: songs she has a cover of, and a short clip of one played in her voice channel,
//   for the song-guessing game. The singing module provides it; without it that game is off.
