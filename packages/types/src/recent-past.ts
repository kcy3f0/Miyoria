// What she can find and connect beyond the line she is answering (docs/design/v4-plan.md §5):
// "just now" across every place, what is going on in the other places she is in, what she last
// talked about with a person (her questions to them, and whether they answered), the person
// profile in one place, and her notebook. All of it is read from what is already kept (the
// EventLog, conversation states, memory, the person cards); none of it runs a model.
//
// The privacy rule every reader here follows (`disclosure`), stated once:
// * What happened in a place the people here can see may be shown: this place, and a place of the
//   same guild unless the owner hid it or `PlaceAccess` says someone here cannot see it.
// * Another guild's places are never shown.
// * A DM is about disclosure, not about her knowing. What she and X said in their DM may inform
//   her only while X is one of the people she is talking with, and it is marked as private: she
//   must not quote or reveal it there. Outside a private place only that it happened comes back
//   (when, that she asked, that X answered), never the words or the topic. Anyone else's DM, or
//   her DM with X when X is not the one she is talking with, never surfaces.
// * Her own state (singing, playing, being in voice) belongs to no one: it is shown everywhere.
