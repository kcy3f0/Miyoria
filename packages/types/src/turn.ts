// Turn ownership (docs/design/v2-architecture.md §3.9): every turn knows whom it answers, new
// input cannot kill it unconditionally, and every turn ends with a recorded outcome.
//
// * `TurnFocus`: who addressed her (`addressed_by`), the messages the reply is for (`focus`:
//   the ones that called her plus the same person's follow-ups) and the rest (`background`).
//   The prompt's "要回的訊息" block shows only `focus`; the reply quotes `focus[0]`.
// * `inputDisposition`: the one cancellation rule (the §3.9 table), shared by the agent's
//   coordinator and anything else that has to tell "worth stopping for" from chatter.
// * `TurnFocusView` (provided by the agent) lets voice barge-in ask, on its hot path, whom the
//   turn in flight is for. Focus changes are also published as `TURN_FOCUS_TOPIC`.
// * `TurnOutcomeRecord` (`TURN_OUTCOME_TOPIC`): sent / silence / cancelled (by whom) / error,
//   for the decision trace ("決定回了但沒發" must have a reason).
//
// Messages are `MessageRef`s; a voice utterance is `{context, id: utterance.id}` (that is how
// the agent already wraps utterances as messages).
