// TTS prefetch: the next lines of a reply are synthesized while the current one plays.
//
// `prepare` tells the voice sink a line is coming; the line's turn at `speak` comes later, after
// the lines before it were played. Synthesizing at `prepare` time hides the TTS latency of every
// line after the first. At most `limit` lines are synthesized at once (the TTS worker is a
// shared GPU), unclaimed lines expire, and a line nobody takes can be cancelled together with the
// rest of its guild's (barge-in, a song taking the floor).
