"""The song worker gives way to her voice while it shares the GPU.

Windows has no GPU priority between processes (MPS is Linux only), so the one thing that works is
not submitting work: while the TTS or ASR worker is busy, the conversion stops between diffusion
steps and separation segments, and goes on when they are done. Stopping costs the song a few
seconds; not stopping costs her first audio seconds, and with her talking that is what people hear.

A background thread polls ``GET /busy`` on the workers, so the conversion's check is a plain read.
A worker that does not answer counts as idle: yielding must never be what stops a song, and neither
must a voice channel that keeps talking, so at most SING_YIELD_MAX_S are given up per job.
